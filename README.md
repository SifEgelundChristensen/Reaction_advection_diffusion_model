Numerical solving of a RAD PDE modelling microplastic sedimentation
2 coupled differential equations solving the concentration of microplastics of two types; A and B (a,b in non-dimensionalized form)
Equation for a is uncoupled from equation b.

Anondim_01: solving the uncoupled equation for a numerically, along with an analytically found steady state solution and seeing how quickly it converges.

Numerical_solution_PDE: using the steady state solution of a in the coupled equation of b, gives an uncoupled equation which is solved numerically and plotted along with an analytical steady state solution.
